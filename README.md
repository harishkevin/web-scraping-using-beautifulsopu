# web-scraping-using-beautifulsopu
BeautifulSoup is a python library used to scrape data from the websites. Here, I have used beautifulsoup to scrape data from timesjob.com.

install the required libraries such as 
          1. bs4(beautifulsoup), 
          2. request - request information from websites, 
          3. lxml - for parsing

find() and find_all() methods are used to find the data from the website

The data is stored onto text file
